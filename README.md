The project involves setting up a database to manage wine reviews data sourced from WineEnthusiast, a wine magazine, and stored in denormalized tables. It includes designing and normalizing tables to ensure data integrity and efficiency. Furthermore, it encompasses tasks such as creating a read-only user for database access and writing SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset, such as identifying highly rated wines, analyzing reviewer preferences, and evaluating wine trends based on geographical locations. Additionally, the project involves reflecting on the database's structure and functionality to assess its effectiveness in representing and analyzing the wine review data.
